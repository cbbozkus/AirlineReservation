Airline Reservation System

In this project, we will implement a flight reservation system for an airline company, which operates multiple flights. Each flight has a unique flight number and is operated with an aircraft that may have a different seating plan. According to its type, an aircraft has a specified number of rows and a specified number of seats in each row. (Although these numbers may change from one aircraft type to another, the number of seats is the same for every row in the same aircraft.)
The reservation system that you will implement should have the following functionalities. The details are given below.
1. Add a flight
2. Cancel a flight
3. Show the list of flights
4. Show detailed information about a particular flight
5. Make a reservation
6. Cancel a reservation
7. Show a reservation
